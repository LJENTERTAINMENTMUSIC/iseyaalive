IṢẸ́YÁÁ DIGITAL OS | FULL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE & PROCESS MAP
================================================================================
Version: 4.2.5 (Production Candidate)
Security Level: PUBLIC / REDACTED
Last Sync: [CURRENT_SYNC_TIMESTAMP]

1. CORE PHILOSOPHY & RUNTIME MECHANICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IṢẸ́YÁÁ (Integrated Sports, Events, Youth, Arts & Attractions) is a government-
owned "Super-App" designed as a unified economic engine for Ogun State.

ARCHITECTURE PATTERN: Zero-Build Browser-Native ESM (Edge Services)
- Transpiler: Babel Standalone (v7) processing .tsx files in-browser.
- Resolution: Import Maps via esm.sh (Zero local node_modules dependency).
- State Engine: React 19 (Transient state with persistent ledger simulation).
- Polyfill: 'process.env' is injected via a root script in index.html to allow
  standard SDK compatibility while protecting secrets via CI/CD injection.

2. LOGIC FLOW: THE USER JOURNEY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase A: Gateway Entry (LandingPage.tsx)
- Entry point for all traffic. Displays high-fidelity "Live Pulse" and
  "Luxury Stay" marquees using CSS-accelerated infinite transforms.
- Logic: Access is gated by a "Choose Protocol" modal.

Phase B: Neural Identity Auth (AuthModal.tsx)
- Logic: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). 
- Roles: User (Public), Vendor (Merchant), Government (Agency), Admin (System).
- Security: Real-world login simulation via Google Protocol. 
- [REDACTED]: Admin access requires email strings ending in verified state 
  domain aliases. Unauthorized attempts trigger a "Pending Approval" state.

Phase C: Command Hub (Layout.tsx / Dashboard.tsx)
- Modular Rendering: App.tsx handles the central view-state.
- Logic: The sidebar dynamically filters modules based on the active Role ID.

3. MODULE FUNCTIONALITY & MECHANICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[I] AI COMMAND AGENT (AIChat.tsx)
- Logic: Gemini-powered multi-modal assistant.
- Mechanics: 
  * Map Grounding: Leverages 'gemini-flash-lite-latest' for venue discovery.
  * Image Synthesis: Uses 'gemini-2.5-flash-image' for visual asset creation.
  * Search Grounding: Pulls real-time Ogun news with citations via 'gemini-3-flash'.

[II] TOURISM & CULTURE (Tourism.tsx)
- Mechanics: 
  * "Story Weaver": Connects to Veo 3.1 engine to deep-dream 4K animations.
  * "Neural Scan": Personalized recommendation algorithm for heritage sites.
  * "Access Ticket": Generates QR-anchored ledger entries for site entry.

[III] MOBILITY & TRANSPORT (Transport.tsx)
- Logic: State-managed ride-hailing and logistics hub.
- Passenger Mode: Route selection -> Fleet Sync -> Driver Intercept.
- Driver Mode: Portal Engagement -> Demand Map -> Mission Acceptance.

[IV] MULTI-MARKETPLACE (Marketplace.tsx)
- Function: Escrow-backed e-commerce for state-certified vendors.
- Mechanics: Vendor Dashboard (Analytics) vs. Buyer Discovery (SEO Grid).
- Settlement: IṢẸ́YÁÁ Wallet integration for zero-fee intra-platform trade.

[V] NEURAL HEALTH (Health.tsx)
- Mechanics: Encrypted "Medical Vault" for PDF record storage.
- Telemedicine: Authenticated video link protocol for verified doctors.

4. PROMPT ENGINEERING & AI PROTOCOLS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system utilizes specific "Prompt Templates" to ensure high-fidelity outputs:

System Instruction (Global):
"You are the ISEYAA AI Agent... professional, authoritative, welcoming... 
Capabilities: Maps-grounding for directions and venue discovery."

Visual Synthesis Protocol:
"4K Illustrator style animation storytelling: [USER_INPUT]. High fidelity, 
dynamic action sequences, rich hand-painted artistic textures, 
epic scale, Ogun State heritage focus."

SEO Scouting Protocol (Blog):
"Search for recent news about Ogun State, Nigeria. Focus on government 
updates, economy, sports, and culture. Extract source URLs from chunks."

5. SECURITY & SECRET MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- API KEYS: Handled exclusively via `process.env.API_KEY`. 
  [SECURITY ALERT]: Never hardcode keys. Inject via GitHub Secrets/CI-CD.
- PAYMENTS: Paystack Public Key anchored to `pk_live_...` for NGN settlement.
- DATA: All medical and financial records are simulated as "Ledger Entries" 
  to prevent PII (Personally Identifiable Information) leaks on public repo.

6. PRIMARY USE CASES (PERSONAS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. LOCAL ARTISAN: Uses 'Marketplace' to upload Adire designs and 
   manages 'Earnings' via the 'Wallet' module.
2. FOREIGN TOURIST: Uses 'Tourism' to watch AI-generated history of Olumo 
   Rock and books 'Accommodation' using the verified guest protocol.
3. STATE OFFICIAL: Accesses 'Government' dashboard for real-time compliance 
   monitoring and revenue tracking across all sectors.
4. COMMUTER: Accesses 'Transport' for real-time bus/taxi tracking anchored 
   to the state mobility grid.
